  "bio": "I'm a product designer and design engineer with 10+ years of experience, specializing in design systems and solving real problems for users. Currently at Feathr, the all-in-one marketing platform for non-profits, while also collaborating with Brave People and other agencies on a contract basis.\n\nMy journey started in 2012 when I launched my first WordPress site and took on freelance graphic design work. In 2015, I landed my first full-time role as a UX designer at Brave People, a digital creative agency. Since then, I've worked across multiple agencies and went in-house in 2021. Along the way, I've partnered with companies like Geico, WebstaurantStore, DTCC, Marriott, Micro Matic and more.\n\nThese days, I'm especially interested in exploring AI workflows that bridge product design and front-end engineering. I love working in that design engineering space where design and code meet.\n\nOriginally from Ohio, I've called Tampa home since 2013. When I'm not designing, you'll find me making coffee, watching sports, traveling, or hanging out with friends.",
