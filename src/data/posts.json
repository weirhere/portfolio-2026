The team developed a high-contrast color scheme to ensure accessibility and a visually appealing interface. All components were meticulously designed and developed to function seamlessly in both light and dark modes, ensuring consistency and usability across all platforms.",

As digital partners, Brave faced the challenge of blending gaming technology with real athletes to reimagine America's favorite sport in a completely fan-driven way.\n\nTo tap into existing UX muscle memory, we designed a platform that leverages natural expectations for a sports league while being visually positioned as something completely new and gamer-centric. Each week, fans have the power to draft players, engage in play-calling during the game, and make coaching/owner decisions for their team.\n\nI designed high-fidelity screens for both the iPhone/Android app and desktop site based on the established design system. The interface features a scalable design system, high-contrast dark interface for accessibility and visibility, color psychology to help users navigate and categorize content, and a balanced approach between requirements and engaging design language.",
